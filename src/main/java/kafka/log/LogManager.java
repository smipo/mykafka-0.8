/**
 * The entry point to the kafka log management subsystem. The log manager is responsible for log creation, retrieval, and cleaning.
 * All read and write operations are delegated to the individual log instances.
 *
 * The log manager maintains logs in one or more directories. New logs are created in the data directory
 * with the fewest logs. No attempt is made to move partitions after the fact or balance based on
 * size or I/O rate.
 *
 * A background thread handles log retention by periodically truncating excess log segments.
